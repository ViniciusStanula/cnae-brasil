# Crawl Experiment: HTML vs JavaScript Links

**Start date:** 2026-05-29  
**Duration:** 6–8 weeks minimum  
**Question:** Does Google (and other bots) discover and crawl pages whose links are injected via JavaScript, compared to pages with hard-coded HTML links?

---

## How the site is split

The 21 CNAE seções (A–U) are split into two groups, alternating by letter:

| Group | Seções (letra) | What happens |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **HTML** (control) | A C E G I K M O Q S U | Divisão links hard-coded in HTML — bots can see them in raw page source |
| **JS** (treatment) | B D F H J L N P R T | Divisão links injected by JavaScript after page load — invisible in raw HTML |

**This applies at every level of the hierarchy.** For JS-group seções, ALL child links (divisão → grupo → classe → subclasse) are JS-injected, not just the first level.

### What a bot sees on an HTML-group seção page (`/cnae/agricultura/`)
Raw HTML contains `<a href="/cnae/agricultura/01/">` — bot can follow it without executing JS.

### What a bot sees on a JS-group seção page (`/cnae/transporte/`)
Raw HTML contains an empty `<div id="js-children">`. Links are only added after the browser/bot runs the `<script>` tag. A bot that does not execute JavaScript will see no links and cannot discover any child pages.

---

## What we deliberately removed to keep the experiment clean

- **Sitemaps disabled** — all sitemap URLs return 404. If sitemaps were active, Google could discover JS-group pages directly from the sitemap, bypassing the link experiment entirely.
- **Breadcrumbs removed** — leaf pages (`/cnae/0135-1-01/`) previously had breadcrumb links pointing back up to divisão/grupo/classe pages. Those upward links would have let bots discover hierarchy pages without needing to follow seção→divisão links.
- **"Onde este CNAE se encaixa" section removed** — leaf pages had a hierarchy panel with direct HTML links to seção/divisão/grupo/classe. Also removed as it was the same confound.

## How logging works

Every bot hit is recorded in two Supabase tables.

### `crawl_logs` — enriched bot-only log
One row per bot request. Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `path` | The URL path that was crawled (e.g. `/cnae/transporte/49/`) |
| `link_type` | `html` = page belongs to HTML group; `js` = JS group; `null` = leaf page or non-CNAE page |
| `crawled_at` | Timestamp of the hit |
| `bot_name` | Which bot: `Googlebot`, `GPTBot`, `Bingbot`, `ClaudeBot`, etc. |
| `referer` | The page the bot came FROM (if sent). Proves discovery chain. |
| `user_agent` | Full UA string |
| `ip` | Bot's IP address |
| `verified` | `true` = reverse DNS confirmed this is a real Googlebot/Bingbot IP (not spoofed) |

**How `link_type` is assigned:** middleware extracts the seção slug from the path (first segment after `/cnae/`), then checks `experiment.config.ts`. All paths under `/cnae/transporte/...` get `link_type = 'js'`. All paths under `/cnae/agricultura/...` get `link_type = 'html'`. Leaf pages like `/cnae/0135-1-01/` get `null` because the código slug isn't a seção slug.

### `request_logs` — raw fallback log of every hit
Every request (humans + bots). Fields: `path`, `hit_at`, `user_agent`, `ip`, `referer`. No bot enrichment. Use this to verify `crawl_logs` is complete, or to identify bots that weren't in our detection list.

## Bots we track

| Bot | Who | rDNS verified |
|-----|-----|--------------|
| Googlebot | Google Search | ✓ |
| Google-InspectionTool | GSC URL inspection | ✗ |
| GoogleOther | Google secondary crawler | ✗ |
| Bingbot | Microsoft Bing | ✓ |
| GPTBot | OpenAI training/search | ✗ |
| OAI-SearchBot | OpenAI SearchGPT | ✗ |
| ClaudeBot | Anthropic | ✗ |
| PerplexityBot | Perplexity AI | ✗ |
| ByteSpider | TikTok/ByteDance | ✗ |
| Applebot | Apple Search | ✗ |
| DuckDuckBot | DuckDuckGo | ✗ |
| YandexBot | Yandex | ✗ |
| AhrefsBot / SemrushBot / MJ12bot | SEO tools | ✗ |
| UnknownBot | Any UA containing "bot/crawler/spider" | ✗ |

"rDNS verified" means we do a reverse DNS lookup to confirm the IP actually belongs to that bot. Only Google and Bing publish verifiable rDNS records.

## Early results (Day 1 — 2026-05-29)

**GPTBot** crawled the site within hours of deployment.

- Hit all 10 JS-group seção pages ✓
- Crawled deep into HTML-group hierarchy: divisão → grupo → classe level ✓
- **Zero JS-group divisão/grupo/classe pages crawled** ✗

Conclusion for GPTBot: **does not execute JavaScript**. It followed HTML links deep into the HTML group but stopped at the seção level for the JS group.

**Googlebot** hit `robots.txt` and homepage on 2026-05-29. Full crawl pending.

## How to export data

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "https://cnaebrasil.com.br/api/export-crawl-logs" `
  -Headers @{"x-export-key"="YOUR_SECRET"} `
  -OutFile crawl-logs.csv
```

## Key analysis queries

**Summary by bot and group:**
```sql
select 
  bot_name,
  link_type,
  count(*) as hits,
  min(crawled_at) as first_hit,
  max(crawled_at) as last_hit
from crawl_logs
where link_type is not null
group by bot_name, link_type
order by bot_name, link_type;
```

**Did any bot reach JS-group hierarchy pages (divisão or deeper)?**
```sql
select path, bot_name, referer, crawled_at
from crawl_logs
where link_type = 'js'
  and path ~ '^/cnae/[^/]+/[^/]+'  -- at least seção/divisão depth
order by crawled_at asc;
```

**Proof of JS execution (bot followed a JS-injected link):**
```sql
select path, bot_name, referer, crawled_at
from crawl_logs
where link_type = 'js'
  and path like '%/%/%'
  and referer is not null
order by crawled_at asc;
```

**Crawl depth reached per bot per group:**
```sql
select
  bot_name,
  link_type,
  length(path) - length(replace(path, '/', '')) - 1 as depth,
  count(*) as pages
from crawl_logs
where link_type is not null
group by bot_name, link_type, depth
order by bot_name, link_type, depth;
```
(depth 2 = seção, 3 = divisão, 4 = grupo, 5 = classe, leaf pages excluded)

## What to look for at the end (6–8 weeks)

1. **Did Googlebot ever reach JS-group divisão/grupo/classe pages?** → Primary experiment result
2. **If yes, what was the referer?** → Proves it followed a JS link vs. found it another way
3. **How does crawl depth compare?** HTML group vs JS group — did Google go equally deep?
4. **Coverage gap** — are there entire JS-group subtrees Google never touched?
5. **Cross-bot comparison** — does GPTBot, Bingbot, ClaudeBot behave differently than Googlebot?
6. **Verify in GSC** — cross-reference indexed pages in Google Search Console with what crawl_logs shows
